# Multi-channel GWR


Batch and incremental learning (with memory replay).

mc_dnm_demo.py runs a demo on the Iris dataset as example.

You can export, import, and plot trained networks using gtls.py

Current code is limited to two input channels.

Feel free to modify the code for more input channels
